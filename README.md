# Sanity Blog (TypeScript)

This is a modern blog application built with [Sanity](https://www.sanity.io/) as a headless CMS and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as the frontend, developed using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The project integrates dynamic content fetching and static generation, allowing you to manage and display blog posts efficiently.

## 🚀 Features

- ⚙️ **Sanity Studio**  
  A fully customizable headless CMS that lets you create and manage your content easily through a user-friendly interface. Designed for developers and content creators alike, it supports custom document types, validation, and real-time collaboration.

- ⚡ **Next.js Frontend**  
  Built using Next.js with Static Site Generation (SSG) and Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) to ensure fast performance, better SEO, and efficient content updates. Routes are dynamically generated from Sanity content, enabling scalability and flexibility.

- 🔒 **TypeScript**  
  The entire codebase uses TypeScript for enhanced developer experience, type safety, and easier debugging. With strong typings for both the frontend and Sanity schemas, it ensures better reliability and maintainability of the project.

- 📝 **Rich Content**  
  Blog posts include support for:

  - Portable text (Sanity's rich text format)
  - Featured images
  - Categories
  - Author details with bios and images  
    This allows for creating engaging and media-rich articles while keeping everything modular and editable in the CMS.

- 📁 **Project Schema**  
  A custom Sanity schema designed to manage portfolio or client projects. Each project includes:
  - **Title** – The name of the project
  - **Description** – A summary of what the project is about
  - **Image** – A hero image or thumbnail for the project
  - **Key Features** – A list of highlights or functionalities
  - **Live Link** – A URL to view the live project
  - **GitHub Repositories** – Links to both client-side and server-side repos (if applicable)
  - **Category** – For grouping or filtering projects
  - **Tech Stack** – Technologies used (e.g., React, Node.js, Tailwind)  
    This makes it perfect for developers and freelancers who want to showcase their work dynamically and professionally.
